                    which a virtual team of real cricket players is created and points are scored depending on how those
                    players perform in real-life matches. To win a tournament, players must work towards attaining the
                    maximum points and the highest rank on the leaderboard.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A fantasy cricket match is based on batting and bowling orders, which
                are the most debated part of cricketing strategy. A small change in the order can change the course of
                the game. The concept involves selecting a team of 11 players and 3 substitutes from the pool of players
                who play the match. There are no budget caps and player selection is not limited to a particular number
                of batters, bowlers and all-rounders although in some fantasy applications you can only create team
                according to their prerequisite patterns. An example of their given pattern could be 5 batters, 1
                wicket-keeper, 2 all-rounders, 3 bowlers. A fantasy team can have any type of players. The main aim in a
                fantasy cricket match is to outscore the opposition by as large of a margin as possible. Fantasy cricket
                matches can be played in all three international forms: One Day International, Twenty20 and Test
                Cricket. The limited over matches, namely the One Day Internationals and Twenty20s, are played in two
                formats – daily games and rounds.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Fantasy cricket is classified as a "game of skill", similar to fantasy
                sports in the United States. Fantasy Cricket for Cash is at the hub of three dynamic industry spokes –
                Internet, gaming and cricket.

                The Supreme Court of India has explained skill in terms of superior knowledge, training, attention,
                experience and adroitness. In K.R. Lakshmanan v. State of Tamil Nadu AIR 1996 SC 1153, it stated as
                follows:

                "A game of skill, on the other hand – although the element of chance necessarily cannot be entirely
                eliminated – is one in which success depends principally upon the superior knowledge, training,
                attention, experience and adroitness of the player."[1]</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Pitch reports and current form of the player matter a lot</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The relevant excerpt from the Supreme Court's judgment is: "There are
                few games, if any, which consist purely of chance or skill, and as such a game of chance is one in which
                the element of chance predominates over the element of skill, and a game of skill is one in which the
                element of skill predominates over the element of chance. It is the dominant element – 'skill' or
                'chance' – which determines the character of the game."[1]

                The court categorically stated the meaning of skill (in paragraph 20), in the following terms: "We,
                therefore, hold that the expression “mere skill” would mean substantial degree or preponderance of
                skill."[1] In the case, the Court considered Section 11 of the Tamil Nadu Gaming Act, which excluded the
                application of the act to games of ‘mere skill’, and is in pari materia with Section 12 of the Public
                Gambling Act of 1867.[2] In that case the Court concluded that horse-racing was a game of skill.</p>
